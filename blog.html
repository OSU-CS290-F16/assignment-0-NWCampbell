    <h3>Campbnat Code Blog First Entry!</h3>
    <p>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
    <br>
    What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <ol>
      <li>Writing this code was actually quite fun, it brought back many memories of different HTML tags I learned as a child.</li>
      <li>However; with the memories came blanks, particularly with not remembering the !DOCTYPE, HTML and Head brackets.</li>
      <li>Friday's lesson actually allowed me to complete the gaps in my memory and create a working HTML code!</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
    <ol><li>I took a look at W3School (a good site to learn to code), the Piazza forum and questions asked by students in class that I didn't think of were VERY helpful.<br>
      Especially with how to publish to the ENGR website. The answers from other students, and some direction from classmates and peers got me set up with GitHub and my ENGR ID</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

<h3>Campbnat Code Blog 2nd Entry</h3>
    <p>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?    <ol>
      <li>CSS is an intuitive and challenging language, personally the biggest issue I had was making an element's position absolute to try and get the dismiss button at the top, but not making its ancestor relative so the button would always be absolute to the window not the sticky note.</li>
      <li>I solved the issue through reading the w3schools and the piazza forums. There's a lot of helpful students on the forums that answer all kinds of questions!</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <ol>
	<li>I learned a lot about using position: relative, and position: absolute. I don't think I inherently knew ANYTHING at all about how to do this assignment before the CSS lectures. :hover will always be your best friend as far as :keyword pseudoclasses go!</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

<h3>Campbnat Code Blog 3rd Entry</h3>
    <p>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
    <ol>
	<li>Finding a correct way to get the X of the dismiss button to match the instructor's
		<ul>
		    <li>It was really frustrating, I was trying to style it, trying to add classes
		    <li>I even tried to copy the X and paste it into the code, which gave a weird error symbol instead!!
		    <li>FINALLY, it just dawned on me. DON'T USE INNERHTML FOR THE INPUTS!!! But you could to create the X via "&times;"!
		</ul>
	<li>It was also a bit irritating for the breaks in each section, because the breaks are read once for some reason.
		<ul>
		    <li>What it all boiled down to was create multiple br elements and input them where needed
		    <li>Such a shame that you couldn't just make ONE and append it multiple times...
		</ul>
	<li>The BIGGEST challenge by far was getting the modal to appear....
		<ul>
		    <li>We were trying to get it to appear via a window.prompt command.... it didn't work.
		    <li>It's a little embarrassing to admit it but my study partner and I didn't actually READ the HTML...
		    <li>However; after reading the HTML we got a great understanding of getting the modal to appear
		    <li>This was achieved by getElementById.... so EASY! Just sometimes you can be blind to obvious answers
		</ul>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <ol>
	    <li>Well, I definitely learned to read the code!
	    <li>Another thing, work with a partner! You may not always get the chance but it is a god-send!
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>What resorces were most helpful?
    <ol>
	    <li>STUDY PARTNER!!!! Joshua Carle is one hell of a stubborn person to not let the code beat him up!
	    <li>Piazza, why I NEVER asked questions there is well beyond me.... it's such a great tool that I forget!
	    <li>And of course my two instructors answers on Piazza, as well as the many student suggestions!!
    </ol>
    </p>
<h3>Campbnat Code Blog 4th Entry</h3>
    <p>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
    <ol>
	<li>Getting the code to read each file and utilize .js and .css files
		<ul>
		    <li>First attempts got it to fs.readFile, and it utilized the .js and .css files however it was reading and writing the files every time they were called
		    <li>The solution? Multiple if statements as part of the handleRequest function! Of course AFTER reading the files once and just referencing the data.
		</ul>
	<li>The BIGGEST challenge by far was getting it to default to the index.html
		<ul>
		    <li>This was also handled with the if statements, referencing what the request length was allowed us to determine whether it should be an error, default or one of the specific files!
		</ul>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <ol>
	    <li>Most of it was learning node syntax from multiple examples of node found online.
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>What resorces were most helpful?
    <ol>
	    <li>Piazza wasn't that helpful this time because I think it was just a difficult assignment everyone needed help with, but remember Josh? He's like the best study partner there is.
    </ol>
