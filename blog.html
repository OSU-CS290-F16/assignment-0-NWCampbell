    <p>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
    <br>
    What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <ul>
      <li>Writing this code was actually quite fun, it brought back many memories of different HTML tags I learned as a child.</li>
      <li>However; with the memories came blanks, particularly with not remembering the !DOCTYPE, HTML and Head brackets.</li>
      <li>Friday's lesson actually allowed me to complete the gaps in my memory and create a working HTML code!</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p></p>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
    <ul>
      <li>I took a look at W3School (a good site to learn to code), the Piazza forum and questions asked by students in class that I didn't think of were VERY helpful.<br>
      Especially with how to publish to the ENGR website.</li>
    </ul></p>
